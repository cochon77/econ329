## Specification Test

Ramsey's RESET Test (p-479), another way of doing F-test 

```{r}
library(lmtest)
x <- c(1:30)
y1 <- 1 + x + x^2 + rnorm(30)
y2 <- 1 + x + rnorm(30)
```

### Test whether including x^2 terms in the model makes it better

```{r}
resettest(y1 ~ x, power = 2, type = "regressor")
```

Including the x^2 makes model better (p-value is small)

```{r}
resettest(y1 ~ x, power = 3, type = "regressor")
```

But the test result does not tell whether inclusion of which power makes the model better

### Overfitting

```{r}
resettest(y2 ~ x, power = 2, type = "regressor")
```

Inclusion of x^2 does not make the model better (p-value is large)

### Nested v. Non-nested Models

Davidson-MacKinnon J Test
